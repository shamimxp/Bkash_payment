                            <h3>HOW IT ALL STARTED</h3>
                            <p>In <strong>April 2020</strong>, the idea of making a dream into reality was made
                                possible to bridge the gap in fashion trends in Bangladesh. Holago was launched and
                                started the production of top-quality clothing designs with the best fabric for the
                                People of Bangladesh. The vision started when our CEO was in the final year of his
                                university degree at the University of Greenwich, London. Being part of an active
                                fashion community with different cultures and diversity, the difference in fashion
                                trends between London and Dhaka seemed far apart. Whereas Bangladesh is one the top
                                exporters of garments worldwide, locally these fashion trends and clothing solutions
                                are unavailable to the regular public.</p>
                            <p>Our E-commerce platform started its operations in April 2020 taking our first online
                                order. In the midst of the pandemic our services were available in the palm of
                                everyone’s hands. We are thrilled to offer a wide range of stylish clothing options
                                for men and women, at competitive prices. Our goal is to provide our customers with
                                a convenient and hassle-free shopping experience.</p>
                            <p>We embarked on our journey keeping our consumers in mind. Consumers are willing to
                                pay 5 times the price tag to wear clothing made by foreign brands as no industry
                                made the effort to solve this problem. With the help of Fashion Designer Daniella
                                Levis(London School of Fashion Graduate) from Portugal, Holago embarked on its
                                mission to bring in top designs and quality fabrics to be produced in Bangladesh and
                                distributed locally to bring about a revolution in Bangladesh’s Fashion Trends.
                                Aiming to go Global starting with The UK, Holago is built on the idea that we will
                                satisfy our consumers with the latest trend in fashion and do so with affordable
                                pricing.</p>
